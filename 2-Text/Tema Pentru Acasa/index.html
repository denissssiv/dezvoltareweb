    <h1>Linkin Park</h1>


    <h2>
        Linkin Park is an American rock band formed in Agoura Hills, California, in 1996. The band's current lineup
        consists of vocalist/rhythm guitarist/keyboardist Mike Shinoda, lead guitarist Brad Delson, DJ/turntablist Joe
        Hahn, bassist Dave Farrell, co-lead vocalist Emily Armstrong, and drummer Colin Brittain. The lineup for the
        band's first seven studio albums included lead vocalist Chester Bennington and drummer Rob Bourdon until
        Bennington's death by suicide in July 2017, which caused the band to enter an indefinite hiatus. In September
        2024, Linkin Park's reformation was announced along with the addition of Armstrong and Brittain.
